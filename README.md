The functions are simple:
 
1) Allow user to search the country

2) Inform client which country user has selected

3) Easily retrieve the selected country's calling code

## About
I needed a country picker that supported getting calling codes.
So I took data from @mledoze's repo and the country picker from @thomasdao and stitched this up.
